## Is light curved by extreme masses and if so, why?
Yes, light can be curved by extreme masses, such as those found in black holes. This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing. When light travels through a region of space that is affected by a strong gravitational field, the path of the light is bent. This is because the gravitational force of the massive object causes the fabric of space-time to warp, causing the light to follow a curved path.




## Is the amount of deviation depending on the mass of the object? does it also depends on the distance between photons and the object?
Yes, the amount of deviation of light due to gravitational lensing depends on the mass of the object causing the lensing and the distance between the light and the object. The larger the mass of the object and the closer the light is to the object, the more the path of the light will be bent.




## So at extreme distances, we can consider light as almost unbent by the massive object ?
At extremely large distances, the gravitational force of a massive object may not be strong enough to significantly bend the path of light. However, it is important to note that even at large distances, the gravitational force of a massive object can still have an effect on the path of light. For example, the gravitational force of the sun is strong enough to cause a small amount of gravitational lensing, which is why we see the phenomenon known as gravitational lensing during solar eclipses.




## And at very small distances, with very massive objects such as black holes, light takes a curve that does not allow escaping the bending of the massive object anymore, right?
Yes, that's correct. At very small distances from a massive object such as a black hole, the gravitational force is so strong that the path of light is bent in a way that does not allow it to escape. This is why anything that gets too close to a black hole, including light, will be trapped by the black hole's gravitational pull and will not be able to escape. This is one of the defining characteristics of a black hole.




## Considering a black hole as the massive object, would you say that the amount of deviation light take is a continuous function of the distance from the object's center?
The amount of deviation of light due to gravitational lensing is a function of the distance from the massive object, but it is not necessarily a continuous function. In the case of a black hole, the gravitational force becomes infinitely strong at the center of the black hole, known as the singularity. At the singularity, the amount of deviation of light becomes infinitely large, and so the function is not continuous at that point.




## But except for limit cases, it should be continuous?
In general, the amount of deviation of light due to gravitational lensing is a continuous function of the distance from the massive object, as long as the light is not too close to the object. As the distance from the object increases, the amount of deviation of the light decreases, and the function becomes smoother and more predictable. However, as the light gets closer to the object, the gravitational force becomes stronger and the amount of deviation increases more rapidly, making the function less smooth and more difficult to predict. This is particularly true in the case of a black hole, where the gravitational force becomes infinitely strong at the singularity.




## Considering all of these elements, there should be a specific distance range from the object where light curves just enough around the object to be sent back to where it came from right?
Yes, that's correct. In the case of a massive object such as a black hole, there is a specific range of distances from the object where light can be bent in a way that allows it to travel in a closed loop around the object. This is known as an "image" of the light source. The specific distance range where this can occur depends on the mass of the object, the distance between the light and the object, and the direction in which the light is traveling.




## If the source is 1 light year away from the object, how much time does it take in this case to be sent back to the source ?
It is not possible to determine the exact amount of time it would take for light to be sent back to its source if the source is 1 light year away from a massive object such as a black hole. This is because the amount of time it would take for the light to be bent back to its source would depend on a number of factors, including the mass of the black hole, the distance between the light and the black hole, and the direction in which the light is traveling. In general, the closer the light is to the black hole, the faster it will be bent back to its source. However, it is important to note that the amount of time it would take for the light to be bent back to its source would be significantly longer than 1 year, since light travels at a speed of approximately 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second), and so it would take light approximately 1 year to travel a distance of 1 light year.
